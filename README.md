# Lutong-bahAI 🍲 ꒰ ៸៸⪫𝅒⪪៸៸ ꒱ 𖹭 

Welcome to **Lutong-bahAI** — my little project where I built a Filipino recipe dataset from scratch through web scraping and data cleaning! ✨  
This is the first step towards creating an **ulam recommender system** that suggests dishes based on the ingredients you already have at home. 🏠🥘

## 🌸 About this Repo
(っ˘ω˘ς ) This is my kusina-inspired coding diary ✨  

- 🥘 Web-scraped **2,000+ Filipino recipes** from [Panlasang Pinoy](https://panlasangpinoy.com/categories/recipes)  
- 🔍 Cleaned and standardized **ingredients list** for easier use in a recommender system  
- 📊 Provided a **ready-to-use dataset** (`cleaned_recipes.csv`) for future experiments (like in Jupyter or a UI app)  
- 💻 Currently includes a **prototype app (`index.html`)** that demonstrates the recipe recommender ✨  
- 💡 To be expanded into a browser-friendly version (Streamlit or Flutter) in the future!

## 📂 Contents
- `index.html` → prototype of the Lutong-bahAI app 🍴  
- `notebooks/` → Jupyter notebooks for scraping + cleaning 🍳  
- `data/`  
   - `scraped_recipes.csv` → raw scraped data  
   - `cleaned_recipes.csv` → processed dataset ready for analysis

## 🛠️ Tools & Tech
- **Python** 🐍 → data scraping & cleaning (BeautifulSoup, Pandas, Regex)  
- **Jupyter Notebook** 📒 → experiments and step-by-step workflow  
- **HTML + JavaScript** 🌐 → simple front-end prototype (`index.html`)  
- **GitHub Pages** 🌍 → hosting the live demo  
- **GitHub** 🐙 → version control & repo hosting

## 🔮 Future AI Integration
The name **Lutong-bahAI** hints at the long-term vision for this project 🌸✨.  
Right now, the app is a simple ingredient-based recipe recommender, but in the future I plan to integrate **AI-powered features**, such as:

1. **Smart Recipe Recommender (NLP + Semantic Search)**  
   - Going beyond keyword matching — the app will *understand* ingredients and still suggest the right dish.  
   - Example: If you enter `manok + suka + bawang`, it should recommend **Adobo** even without typing “toyo.”  

2. **Ingredient Substitution AI**  
   - Suggests alternatives when you’re missing something in your pantry.  
   - Example: *“No calamansi? Try lemon, or vinegar + sugar.”*  

With these, **Lutong-bahAI** aims to become your **smart kusina buddy** that helps you cook delicious meals with what you already have at home. 🏠🥘

## 🌟 Final Notes
Made with 🍲, 🐍, and a dash of ≽(•⩊ •マ≼  
Excited to grow this into a full **recommender app** — stay tuned!
