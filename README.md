# Lutong-bahAI 🍲 ꒰ ៸៸⪫𝅒⪪៸៸ ꒱ 𖹭 

Welcome to **Lutong-bahAI** — my little project where I built a Filipino recipe dataset from scratch through web scraping and data cleaning! ✨  
This is the first step towards creating an **ulam recommender system** that suggests dishes based on the ingredients you already have at home. 🏠🥘

## 🌸 About this Repo
(っ˘ω˘ς ) This is my kusina-inspired coding diary ✨  

- 🥘 Web-scraped **2,000+ Filipino recipes** from [Panlasang Pinoy](https://panlasangpinoy.com/categories/recipes)  
- 🔍 Cleaned and standardized **ingredients list** for easier use in a recommender system  
- 📊 Provided a **ready-to-use dataset** (`cleaned_recipes.csv`) for future experiments (like in Jupyter or a UI app)  
- 💻 Currently includes a **prototype app (`index.html`)** that demonstrates the recipe recommender ✨  
- 💡 To be expanded into a browser-friendly version (Streamlit or Flutter) in the future!

## 🔮 Future AI Integration
(｡•́︿•̀｡) The name **Lutong-bahAI** might sound a little extra right now since wala pa talaga siyang “AI” inside… *yet*!  
But this project is meant to grow, and here’s what I dream of adding someday ✨🌸  

1. **Smart Recipe Recommender (NLP + Semantic Search)**  
   - Going beyond plain keyword matching — the app will *understand* your ingredients and suggest the right ulam.  
   - Example: If you enter `manok + suka + bawang`, it should still recommend **Adobo** even without typing “toyo.” (｡•̀ᴗ-)✧  

2. **Ingredient Substitution AI**  
   - Suggests cute alternatives when you’re missing something.  
   - Example: *“No calamansi? Try lemon, or vinegar + sugar.”* (✿◠‿◠)  

With these, **Lutong-bahAI** will truly become a **smart kusina buddy** that helps you cook yummy meals with whatever you already have at home. 🏠🥘

## 🌟 Final Notes
Made with 🍲, 🐍, and a dash of ≽(•⩊ •マ≼  
Excited to grow this into a full **recommender ai app** — stay tuned!
