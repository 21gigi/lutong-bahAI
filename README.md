# Lutong-bahAI 🍲 ꒰ ៸៸⪫𝅒⪪៸៸ ꒱ 𖹭 

Welcome to **Lutong-bahAI** — my little project where I built a Filipino recipe dataset from scratch through web scraping and data cleaning! ✨  
This is the first step towards creating an **ulam recommender system** that suggests dishes based on the ingredients you already have at home. 🏠🥘

## 🌸 About this Repo
(っ˘ω˘ς ) This is my kusina-inspired coding diary ✨  

- 🥘 Web-scraped **2,000+ Filipino recipes** from [Panlasang Pinoy](https://panlasangpinoy.com/categories/recipes)  
- 🔍 Cleaned and standardized **ingredients list** for easier use in a recommender system  
- 📊 Provided a **ready-to-use dataset** (`cleaned_recipes.csv`) for future experiments (like in Jupyter or a UI app)  
- 💻 Currently includes a **prototype app (`index.html`)** that demonstrates the recipe recommender ✨  
- 💡 To be expanded into a browser-friendly version (Streamlit or Flutter) in the future!
