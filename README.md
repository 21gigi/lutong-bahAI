# Lutong-bahAI 🍲 (๑•̀ㅂ•́)و✧

Welcome to **Lutong-bahAI** — my little project where I built a Filipino recipe dataset from scratch through web scraping and data cleaning! ✨  
This is the first step towards creating an **ulam recommender system** that suggests dishes based on the ingredients you already have at home. 🏠🥘

## 🌸 About this Repo
(っ˘ω˘ς ) This is my kusina-inspired coding diary ✨  

- 🥘 Web-scraped 2,000+ Filipino recipes from [Panlasang Pinoy](https://panlasangpinoy.com/categories/recipes)  
- 🔍 Cleaned and standardized ingredients list for easier use in a recommender system  
- 📊 Ready-to-use dataset (`cleaned_recipes.csv`) for future experiments (like in Jupyter or a UI app)  
- 💡 To be expanded into a browser-friendly app soon (Streamlit or Flutter!)

## 🌟 Final Notes
Made with 🍲, 🐍, and a dash of (´｡• ᵕ ｡`) ♡  
Excited to grow this into a full **recommender app** — stay tuned!
